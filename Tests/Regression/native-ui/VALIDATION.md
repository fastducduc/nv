# Validation on September 7, 2026

The host ran macOS 13.7.8 with Xcode 15.2 and the macOS 14.2 SDK. The app used an Intel Development build under Rosetta.

## Results

- The Development build completed.
- `Tests/run-multiple-windows-tests.py` passed 35 checks and 13 relaunch checks.
- `Tests/run-regression-tests.py` passed all checks, including 41 native UI checks and the ownership and restoration mutations.
- Light and dark snapshots showed both panes across the window width, with the list above the editor.

## Performance sample

The comparison used the merged baseline `116daff` and the native UI build. Both runs used 10,000 generated notes and a 640-by-160-point table viewport.

| Operation | Baseline median / p95 | Native UI median / p95 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Four filter queries | 62.55 / 64.84 ms | 61.44 / 64.33 ms |
| Scroll and table bitmap capture | 17.14 / 31.04 ms | 18.54 / 34.39 ms |

The fixture used 30 query sequences and 60 scroll operations. These measurements represent one run per build. Bitmap capture includes capture costs and does not measure animation frame rate.

## Remaining manual checks

The desktop session was locked. Full-screen transitions failed in both nvALT and an isolated stock Cocoa window because neither app became active. The optional full-screen test requires an unlocked desktop session.

Ventura logged a layout warning during `NSSearchToolbarItem` layout. An LLDB trace placed the recursive layout call inside AppKit toolbar constraints. The resize and control checks passed despite this warning.

External editor applications and other macOS versions were not exercised.
