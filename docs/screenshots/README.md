# README screenshots

The original three images show the Development app from revision `379f09a`, captured on September 7, 2026.
The host ran macOS 13.7.8 with Xcode 15.2. The Intel app ran under Rosetta.

- `native-light.png` shows the full library in light appearance.
- `native-dark.png` shows the same note in dark appearance.
- `multiple-windows.png` shows two windows with separate searches and divider heights.

All notes are sample content. The capture used a temporary library and a separate settings domain.
The capture skipped sync, update checks, and external editor initialization.
The images contain native app windows without annotations or changes to the pixels.

`source-editor.png` and `readonly-viewer.png` show the source redesign on September 8, 2026.
The host ran macOS 26.5.2 with Xcode 26.6 and SDK 26.5. The Intel app ran under Rosetta.
The `source-workflow` regression suite captured the native window after its next frame was presented.
These images contain disposable source fixtures, with no annotations or pixel changes.

To refresh this pair after a Development build:

```sh
NV_UI_ARTIFACTS="$PWD/build/source-viewer-artifacts" python3 Tests/Regression/source-workflow/run.py
```

Inspect `editable-source.png` and `readonly-preview.png` in that output directory before replacing the two documentation images.

## Refresh the original images

1. Build the app with the command in the [main README](../../README.markdown#build-and-run).
2. Use a disposable library with sample notes.
3. Capture the light and dark appearances of one window.
4. Capture two windows with different searches.
5. Replace the PNG files in this directory.
6. Update the revision and environment in this file.
