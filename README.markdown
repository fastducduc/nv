# nvALT — dangduc fork

nvALT is a macOS notes app with search and Markdown previews. This fork of [ttscoff/nv](https://github.com/ttscoff/nv) adds multiple windows and native macOS controls.

Every window keeps the notes list above the editor. All windows share one notes library.

## What changes in this fork

| Area | Upstream nvALT | This fork |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | One main notes window. | Multiple windows share one library. Each window has its own search, selection, sort order, and scroll position. |
| Layout | Stacked or side-by-side panes. | The notes list always stays above the editor. Each window saves its divider height. |
| Controls | Custom window controls and a combined search/title field. | A native toolbar contains Search or Create. Separate fields edit the title and tags. |
| Search | The combined field also shows the selected title. | The search query stays visible after selection changes. An unmatched query offers an explicit Create action. |
| Appearance | Legacy window controls and color schemes. | Native macOS controls, automatic editor colors, and a white notes list in light and dark appearances. |

Saved side-by-side layouts restore as stacked panes. The fork retains Markdown, MultiMarkdown, and Textile previews, note links, tags, import/export, and custom editor fonts.

### Multiple windows

Each window can show a different note or search. Edits to the same note appear in all windows that show that note. Undo and Redo share the history for that note, including committed title and tag edits.

The app restores open windows and their saved views after a restart. A library change applies to all windows.

### Native controls and appearance

The toolbar contains New Note, Preview, Note Actions, Sync Status, and Search or Create. Standard toolbar customization controls which items appear.

The title and tags sit between the list and the body. Tags use completion from the library. The editor supports system colors and custom colors. The notes list stays white, with optional pale alternating rows.

These screenshots use sample notes on macOS 13.7.8. Control appearance can differ across macOS versions.

## Use the app

| Action | Instruction |
| --- | --- |
| Open another window | Choose **Window > New Window**, or press **Command-Shift-N**. |
| Create a blank note | Press **Command-N**. Then enter the title. |
| Find a note | Type in **Search or Create**. Use **Command-J** or **Command-K** to move through the results. |
| Edit a search result | Select the note. Then press **Return**. |
| Create from a search | If no note matches, press **Return** or click **Create**. |
| Edit the title or tags | Edit the field above the body. Press **Return** to commit, or **Escape** to cancel. |
| Resize the list | Drag the divider between the list and the editor. |
| Use system colors | Select **Follow System Appearance** in the color menu. |
| Open a preview | Click **Preview** in the toolbar. |

## Automated builds

The [macOS build workflow](https://github.com/dangduc/nv/actions/workflows/macos.yml) runs for pull requests to `master`, pushes to `master`, and manual runs.
It uses an Intel macOS 15 runner with Xcode 16.4.

1. Open a successful workflow run.
2. Download `nvALT-macos-x86_64-<run number>-<attempt>.zip` from **Artifacts**.
3. Extract `nvALT.app` from the ZIP file.

Downloads require a GitHub login. App archives expire after 30 days.
These are unsigned Development builds without notarization or Simplenote credentials. Apple Silicon Macs require Rosetta.

Successful `master` builds create a `build-<run number>` tag at the built commit.
A rerun keeps the same tag. Pull requests and manual runs on other branches do not create tags.
Build tags do not change the app version or create GitHub Releases.

CI checks the tag logic and builds the app. It also checks executable permissions for the app and MultiMarkdown in the archive.
The desktop integration suites remain separate. [Tests/CI/README.md](Tests/CI/README.md) describes the CI checks and tag rules.

## Dependency changes

This fork uses `NSJSONSerialization`, `NSDataDetector`, and native `NSPopover` windows.
Automatic updates and the Check for Updates menu items are disabled.

HTML files, web archives, and web-page downloads cannot be imported.
Pasted URLs remain plain text. Browser paste uses a plain-text representation when available.
The `nvalt://make` action accepts `txt`; its `html` and `url` import parameters are disabled.
Existing HTML notes remain readable. Markup previews and HTML export remain available.

## Build and run

The [official nvALT download](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) contains upstream nvALT, without these fork changes.

The build requires full Xcode. Command Line Tools alone are insufficient.
The bundled MultiMarkdown executable and OpenSSL archive require an Intel build. Apple Silicon Macs need Rosetta.

The command below passed on macOS 13.7.8 with Xcode 15.2 and the macOS 14.2 SDK. Other macOS and Xcode versions need separate checks.

1. Clone this fork:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dangduc/nv.git
   cd nv
   ```

2. Prepare the sync configuration:

   For an existing checkout, move your local `SimperiumConfig.h` into `Config/` before you build.

   If `Config/SimperiumConfig.h` is absent, create it from the example:

   ```sh
   test -e Config/SimperiumConfig.h || cp Config/SimperiumConfig-example.h Config/SimperiumConfig.h
   ```

   The placeholder supports local use without sync. Simplenote sync requires your own API key.

3. Build the Development app:

   ```sh
   xcodebuild -project Notation.xcodeproj -scheme 'Notation Develop' \
     -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData ARCHS=x86_64 \
     MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13 CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
     GENERATE_PROFILING_CODE=NO OTHER_CFLAGS= WARNING_LDFLAGS= build
   ```

4. Quit any other nvALT build before the first run.
5. Run the app:

   ```sh
   open build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Development/nvALT.app
   ```

The build retains the upstream application identifier and can use existing nvALT settings and notes. The built-in updater still points to upstream. Updates to this fork require a new local build or CI artifact.

## Development checks

### Project layout

| Directory | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Sources/` | Application code, grouped by responsibility. Headers stay beside their implementations. |
| `Resources/` | Images, help, preview templates, interfaces, and localized resources in `Localization/*.lproj/`. |
| `Config/` | Application plist, prefix header, sync configuration, and linker order files. |
| `ThirdParty/` | Bundled source dependencies, markup processors, and OpenSSL. |
| `Scripts/` | Development utilities. |
| `Tests/` | Cocoa integration suites, regression checks, CI checks, and review records. |
| `docs/` | Documentation assets and screenshots. |

`Notation.xcodeproj` stays at the repository root. Its navigator groups match the directories on disk.

### Run the suites

After a Development build, run these commands from an active desktop session:

```sh
python3 Tests/run-multiple-windows-tests.py
python3 Tests/run-regression-tests.py
```

The suites use temporary notes and a copy of the app. They cover shared edits, Undo/Redo, window restoration, search, metadata, preview ownership, and appearance.

[Tests/README.md](Tests/README.md) describes focused checks and full-screen checks. [The review record](Tests/NativeUIReview/VALIDATION.md) lists results and limits. Live sync services and external editor apps need separate manual checks.

## Preview customization

1. Choose **Open Custom CSS Folder** from the Preview menu.
2. Edit `template.html` for the HTML structure.
3. Edit `custom.css` for the preview styles.

The preview also supports JavaScript in the template. Missing custom files use the bundled defaults.
